Graduate Certificate Intelligent Sensing Systems Practice Module Report: PROJECT GAMEFACE

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The motivation of our project is to explore using different human physical attributes, like head pose and face actions to implement a vision system that can help people with certain physical disabilities to be able to interact with a computer. Our team conducted research on and experimented with various detection algorithms with the aim of finding a suitable model that can help us achieve this goal. We have also explored various approaches to determine the different head pose and face actions in order to convert these responses into control commands that can be sent via a computer linked to a webcam. After all the experimentation of the various methods, the final system was designed utilizing the landmark tracking based approach - FaceMesh, which is one of the suite of Machine Learning tools from MediaPipe developed by Google. This light weight model was consistently able to help us achieve real-time detection in a fast and accurate way. Finally our team was able to successfully develop a vision system using FaceMesh as its main detection and tracking engine, and also demonstrated the ability for users to have fun with online games simply by moving their head and doing actions with their eyes and mouth.

## INTRODUCTION

Currently, people living with different physical disabilities need to buy expensive third party peripherals in order to supply inputs to their computer systems and enjoy playing video games. We aim to develop a vision system which will allow Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in a fun and affordable way, using human gesture and pose recognition.

The input to our proposed system are video images which can be from a simple webcam linked to a computer. We then use a Head Pose tracking model to identify various positions of the head in order to provide real time differentiated responses to send commands to the computer. This allows people who may have difficulties moving their limbs to interact with online games using different head postures simply through a low cost webcam.
