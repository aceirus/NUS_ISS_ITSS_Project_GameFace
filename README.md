Graduate Certificate Intelligent Sensing Systems Practice Module Report: PROJECT GAMEFACE

## INTRODUCTION

Currently, people living with different physical disabilities need to buy expensive third party peripherals in order to supply inputs to their computer systems and enjoy playing video games. We aim to develop a vision system which will allow Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in a fun and affordable way, using human gesture and pose recognition.

The input to our proposed system are video images which can be from a simple webcam linked to a computer. We then use a Head Pose tracking model to identify various positions of the head in order to provide real time differentiated responses to send commands to the computer. This allows people who may have difficulties moving their limbs to interact with online games using different head postures simply through a low cost webcam.
